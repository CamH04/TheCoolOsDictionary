Do you want a *very* old style OS to tinker and try, if so BleskOS is a fantastic option

> 32-bit operating system written from scratch, with alternative user interface, designed for older computers with intention to provide system that will make them usable again 

- BleskOS comes bundled with its own bootloader!
- This repo has 4 other contributors
- has an impressive list of drivers, especially considering the size of the dev team 
- I personally found this OS while browsing the [OsDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) !
- its an amazing source for learning kernel development for yourself

 
## Ux
Keybinds go as follows: 
- ESC = Back to Main window
- F1 = Open file
- F2 = Save file
- F3 = New file
- F4 = Close file
- F5/F6 = Select another file on left/right

As someone who likes older styled OS's i am quite a big fan of the feel and style of the OS

- ./compile.sh
- ./compile fast
