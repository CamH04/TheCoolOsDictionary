@v@ , volare sicut tyto noctua

*Yes this is my own OS ... i just want to include it as i truley have put a lot of work and time into this OS as well as it being the start of my own personal fascination of os's*

> AlbaOS 1.0 is a 32-bit terminal based operating system, built from scratch using C++ and Assembly that follows a megalithic kernel structure. Made by a kid (me) who has a lot to learn. The name AlbaOS comes from my love of owls (my favourite being the barn owl). The barn owl has the latin name of Tyto Alba, i thought AlbaOS had a nicer ring to it than TytoOS

- terminal based
- it uses GRUB as the bootloader

### Builds

1. AlbaOS (x86 32 bit)
2. AlbaOS For Arm (Rpi 4 and Cortex-A15)

4. AlbaOS Rusty (Rewrite Of x86 build in rust)
